Cases vs variables
========================================================

Suppose you are conducting a test on a webpage redesign. You create two versions, randomly showing the different versions to different people. You measure how much time each person spends on the page, how many links they click on, and their operating system.

What are the:

Returning to the decks of cards
===
incremental:false

Report:
* Which deck?
* Methods
  * How many cards?
  * How was each selected?
* List of parameters
* List of statistics and the value of each one
* Expected value for each statistic (assuming a fair deck)
* Conclusion
  * Is the deck fair?
  * How much $ would you wager?

The questions
===
incremental:false
1. What will your sample be? How many cards will you
draw?

2. How will you select each card from the deck? Be 
specific enough so that a classmate could do exactly 
what you did. 

3. What parameters would you like to estimate? (For 
example, “the % of all cards that are face cards” is a 
possible parameter.) List all of the parameters you will 
look at.

4. For each parameter, what statistic will you measure? 
List all of them.

5. For each statistic, what value would you expect it to 
have if your deck were fair?

Associations of handedness with hair color and learning disabilities

Abstract

Forms containing the Edinburgh handedness inventory and questions about learning disabilities, hair color, self-described handedness, age, gender, parental handedness and twinning were received from 1117 randomly selected professionals. Laterality scores (LS, range −100 to + 100) were calculated for each respondent based on the handedness inventory and were correlated with the above variables. Among blonds, the frequency of non right-handedness (NRH, LS ⩽70) was 44% compared to 24% of non-blonds (x2=23.5, P <0.0001). Learning disabilities (LD) were present in 9% of NRH (LS ⩽70) as against 3% of those with LS > 70 (x2=22.1, P<0.0001). Associations between LS and self-described handedness, parental handedness, gender, and age are also presented. Possible explanations for the association of hair color and handedness are discussed in light of recent data on altered visual system pathways in albinos. Problems in the measurement of handedness are discussed.

Explanatory vs response variables
===
What would each be in the previous example?

Association vs causation
===
What's the difference?

* Ice cream sales and shark attacks
* Children with larger shoe sizes read better
* Countries with more TV sets per person have longer life expectancy
* Study time and test scores

Interpreting experiments
===
To investigate the safety of the anesthetics used in surgery, records from 850,000 operations in 34
major hospitals were examined. The death rates for four common anesthetics are shown in the table.

| Anesthetic | A    | B    | C    | D    |
|------------|------|------|------|------|
| Death Rate | 1.7% | 1.7% | 3.4% | 1.7% |

Which is the explanatory variable and which is the response variable?

Observational or experimental study?

Which hospital would you go to?


Sampling
===
Sampling techniques:
* Simple random sampling
* Stratified sampling
* Cluster sampling
* Multistage sampling

When might you use each?

An Example
===
You want to know the caloric intake of MLB players. You survey 3 players from each team. This is:

A. Simple random sampling
B. Stratified sampling
C. Cluster sampling
D. Multistage sampling

An Example
===
You want to know the caloric intake of MLB players. You survey 2 entire teams. This is:

A. Simple random sampling
B. Stratified sampling
C. Cluster sampling
D. Multistage sampling

An Example
===
You want to know the caloric intake of MLB players. You survey 3 players from each of 7 randomly chosen team. This is:

A. Simple random sampling
B. Stratified sampling
C. Cluster sampling
D. Multistage sampling
