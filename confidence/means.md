Reminder
===
What was a sampling distribution?

Let's consider a deck of cards - again
===

Suppose we want to know the *mean* of the deck

Grab A Deck
===

- How many cards should we draw?
- How should we draw them?
- Draw that many, then calculate the mean, we'll record this

Let's draw the distribution
===
What *would* the distribution look like?

What do we get
===
* This is a sampling distribution for $\bar{x}$
* It should look nearly normal (Central limit theorem)
* The mean of the distribution will be $\mu$
* The standard deviation will be

$$\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \textrm{ (Standard error)}$$

Assumptions
===
* Observations independent ($<10\%$ of population)
* Samples size $\geq 30$ (rule of thumb)
* Data not strongly skewed

Confidence interval
===
* What's the formula for a 95% confidence interval for means?
* What's the standard error?
* What's the margin of error?

A Confidence Interval As A Test
===
* An $\alpha$ level is stated *before* data is collected to determine a level of acceptable risk in the test (we'll be more specific about this later).
* If you make a 95% CI, $\alpha=0.05$
* If you make a 99% CI, $\alpha=0.01$
* In general, is the level of confidence is $X$, $\alpha=1-X$
