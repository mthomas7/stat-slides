Reminder
===
What was a sampling distribution?

Let's consider a deck of cards - again
===

Suppose we want to know the *mean* of the deck

Grab A Deck
===

- How many cards should we draw?
- How should we draw them?
- Draw that many, then calculate the mean, we'll record this
- Do this 10 times
- What if we drew a different number?
- How would this change the distribution?

Let's draw the distribution
===

What do we get
===
* This is a sampling distribution for $\bar{x}$
* It should look nearly normal
