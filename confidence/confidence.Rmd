## Let's consider a deck of cards

* Suppose face cards are worth 10
* What's the average of the entire deck
    * That seems like a pain to calculate
    * We can sample instead of calculating the actual mean
    
## Grab A Deck

- How many cards should we draw?
- Draw that many, then take the average, we'll record this

> - What if we drew a different number?
> - How would this change the distribution?
