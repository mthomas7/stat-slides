Abstract

Forms containing the Edinburgh handedness inventory and questions about learning disabilities, hair color, self-described handedness, age, gender, parental handedness and twinning were received from 1117 randomly selected professionals. Laterality scores (LS, range −100 to + 100) were calculated for each respondent based on the handedness inventory and were correlated with the above variables. Among blonds, the frequency of non right-handedness (NRH, LS ⩽70) was 44% compared to 24% of non-blonds (x2=23.5, P <0.0001). Learning disabilities (LD) were present in 9% of NRH (LS ⩽70) as against 3% of those with LS > 70 (x2=22.1, P<0.0001). Associations between LS and self-described handedness, parental handedness, gender, and age are also presented. Possible explanations for the association of hair color and handedness are discussed in light of recent data on altered visual system pathways in albinos. Problems in the measurement of handedness are discussed.
