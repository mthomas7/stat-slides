## Building a sampling distribution

Grab a deck of cards for yourself and a partner. We're going to estimate the mean "value" of the deck.

Aces will be worth 1, facecards worth 11, and numbered cards will be worth their number.

Draw a card, record its value, place it back in the deck. Repeat until you have 10 draws. Average your values.

## Getting a sense of the distribution

## Editing the distribution

Draw what you think the distribution would look like it:

* We had each drawn 20 cards instead of 10?
* We had each drawn 5 cards instead of 10?
* The class had 100 people in it?
* The class had 5 people in it?
