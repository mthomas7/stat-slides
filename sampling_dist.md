The questions
===
1. What will your sample be? How many cards will you
draw?

2. How will you select each card from the deck? Be 
specific enough so that a classmate could do exactly 
what you did. 

3. What parameters would you like to estimate? (For 
example, “the % of all cards that are face cards” is a 
possible parameter.) List all of the parameters you will 
look at.

4. For each parameter, what statistic will you measure? 
List all of them.

5. For each statistic, what value would you expect it to 
have if your deck were fair?
