Numerical Data

Reminder
===
What's a numerical variable?

What are the types?

Means
===
How do we compute it?

For what kind of data?

Mean formula
===
$$\bar{x} = \dfrac{x_1+x_2+x_3+\ldots+x_n}{n}$$

- $\bar{x}$ vs $\mu$

Compared to...
===
Median - What does is measure?

Mode - What does it measure?

(What if there are an even number of numbers?)


Why the choices?
===
Why do you think we might have different "measures of center"?


1 Variable: Histograms
===
What kind of data? (other graphs will be explored in the lab)

Skew
===
What does skew measure?

Measuring the spread of data: Standard deviation vs IQR
===
incremental:true
How are each computed?

Let's build the formula for standard deviation...

SD: Why do we take the square root?

$\sigma$ vs $s$

Why denominator of $n-1$?


Outliers
===
Rules for Medians/IQR: 1.5 * IQR

On a histogram...
===
* Mean is a balance point
* Median has half the data on either side
* SD is the "average distance from the mean"

Sensitivity
===
incremental:true
Which of the statistics are sensitive vs robust?

How can we tell?

In the # of death penalty cases, what happens if Texas is removed?

Example
===
Data set: 1, 2, 9, 20, 5

Mean? Median? SD?

Why is the mean larger than the median?

Making box plots
===
What kind of information does this display?

Notation
===
* Sample mean: $\bar{x}$
* Population mean: $\mu$
* Sample proportion: $\hat{p}$
* Population proportion: $p$

2 Variables: Scatterplots
===
How do we use explanatory vs response variables? (When relevant)

Going back to the cdc example...

What does the scatterplot tell us? What does the scatterplot not tell us?
