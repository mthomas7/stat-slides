Reminder

What's a numerical variable?

What are the types?

Means
===
For what kind of data?

How do we compute?

Histograms
===
What kind of data?

Skew
===
What does skew measure?

Mode

What does it measure?

Median
===
What does is measure?

What if there are an even number of numbers?

Standard deviation vs IQR
===
How are each computed?

SD: Why do we take the square root?

$\sigma$ vs $s$

Why denominator of $n-1$?

On a histogram...
===
* Mean is a balance point
* Median has half the data on either side
* SD is the "average distance from the mean"

Sensitivity
===
Which of the statistics are sensitive vs robust?

How can we tell?

In the # of death penalty cases, what happens if Texas is removed?

Example
===

Data set: 1, 2, 9, 20, 5

Mean? Median? SD?

Why is the mean larger than the median?

Making box plots
===
What kind of information does this display?


Contingency tables
===
For what type of data?

Notation
===
* Sample mean: $\bar{x}$
* Population mean: $\mu$
* Sample proportion: $\hat{p}$
* Population proportion: $p$




Returning to the decks of cards
===
Report:
* Which deck?
* Methods
  * How many cards?
  * How was each selected?
* List of parameters
* List of statistics and the value of each one
* Expected value for each statistic (assuming a fair deck)
* Conclusion
  * Is the deck fair?Hi everyone,

I need to make a slight change in office hours this week - the Wednesday office hours normall from 10-11:30 will have to be moved to 2-3:30 (just for this week).

Matt
  * How much $ would you wager?

The questions
===
1. What will your sample be? How many cards will you
draw?

2. How will you select each card from the deck? Be 
specific enough so that a classmate could do exactly 
what you did. 

3. What parameters would you like to estimate? (For 
example, “the % of all cards that are face cards” is a 
possible parameter.) List all of the parameters you will 
look at.

4. For each parameter, what statistic will you measure? 
List all of them.

5. For each statistic, what value would you expect it to 
have if your deck were fair?

Associations of handedness with hair color and learning disabilities

Abstract

Forms containing the Edinburgh handedness inventory and questions about learning disabilities, hair color, self-described handedness, age, gender, parental handedness and twinning were received from 1117 randomly selected professionals. Laterality scores (LS, range −100 to + 100) were calculated for each respondent based on the handedness inventory and were correlated with the above variables. Among blonds, the frequency of non right-handedness (NRH, LS ⩽70) was 44% compared to 24% of non-blonds (x2=23.5, P <0.0001). Learning disabilities (LD) were present in 9% of NRH (LS ⩽70) as against 3% of those with LS > 70 (x2=22.1, P<0.0001). Associations between LS and self-described handedness, parental handedness, gender, and age are also presented. Possible explanations for the association of hair color and handedness are discussed in light of recent data on altered visual system pathways in albinos. Problems in the measurement of handedness are discussed.
